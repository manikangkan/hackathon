## 🤔 Objective
Create a hackathon app where one can create hackathon & see the list. 

## 🥇 Context
Imagine you are working for an Edtech company and you are asked to create a simple application that will allow to create a hackathon and seek participation to get solutions. The hackathon consists of a problem statement which can be accessed by participants to solve and make a submission. Here let’s imagine those who create a hackathon as organizer and those who can take part in it as “participant(s)”. Now as a developer you are asked to create a dashboard for organizer to create a hackathon.

## 🐤 Application overview

- Oragnizers should be able to create, edit, and delete hackathons.
  - Every hackathon should contain the following data -
    - Name
    - Start date 
    - End date
    - Description
    - Image
    - Level (easy, hard, medium)

- Organizers should be able to see list of hackathons created, sort, search, filter and preview -    
  - Organizers should also be able to sort the challenges (newest first and oldest first), can filter using level (easy, medium, hard) and status (active, upcoming, past), and can search hackathon using the name.
  - Active hackathons card should have a timer that will show when it will end.
  - Upcoming hackathons card should have a timer that will show when it will start.
  - Past hackathons card should have a start & end date.
  - When clicked on the hackathon it should take the user to the page where the user can see all the data related to hackathon.
    - On this page, there should be an edit & delete button.
